Agent Interoperability Protocol (AIP)
Introduction
Modern AI agents increasingly rely on external tools and services to complete real-world tasks. These tools may be local processes, remote services, or MCP servers exposing structured capabilities. Today, integrating such tools into agents is largely manual. Each integration requires custom installation steps, configuration logic, and hardcoded knowledge of how to invoke the tool correctly. This limits scalability, reuse, and autonomy.
The Agent Interoperability Protocol (AIP) defines a standard way for agents to discover, install, configure, and use external capabilities automatically.
AIP introduces a common language between agents and capability providers. Instead of embedding tool-specific logic inside the agent, capabilities describe themselves through a machine-readable manifest. Agents use this manifest to understand what a capability can do, how it should be installed, what permissions it requires, and how its skills can be invoked.
The goal of AIP is to enable agents to dynamically acquire new skills at runtime in a safe and predictable manner. An agent should be able to evaluate whether a capability is relevant to a task, install it if needed, load its skills, and improve its usage over time based on outcomes. This allows agents to adapt to new environments and tasks without requiring code changes or manual configuration.
AIP is designed to complement existing systems rather than replace them. It works alongside MCP servers, agent frameworks, and orchestration layers. AIP does not define how agents reason, plan, or generate language. It focuses solely on interoperability between agents and external capabilities.
By standardizing capability discovery and skill usage, AIP aims to reduce integration friction, encourage reuse of tooling, and support the development of more autonomous and maintainable agent systems.
